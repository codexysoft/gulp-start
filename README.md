## Documentation

### Structure

`/src/` - here your source code.

`/dist/` - here compiled code. Do not edit this folder.

### Tasks

`gulp` - default task

`gulp clean` - clean task for dist folder

`gulp convertFonts` - task for fonts conversion


### SASS

Sass files are located in the `src/assets/stylesheets/` directory.

We use BEM methodology and structure the files into the blocks `src/assets/stylesheets/blocks/`.

All blocks and other styles should be imported in the `src/assets/stylesheets/style.sass` manifest file.

It will be compiled in the `dist/css/style.css` directory.

`node_modules` path is included for importing vendor files.

### PUG

Pug files are located in the `src/views/` directory.

New pages should be here `src/views/pages/`.

Partials, like footer or header should be here `src/views/partials/`.

Pages will be converted into `dist` directory.

### Javascript

Put your JavaScript files in the `src/assets/js` directory.

All js files should be imported in the manifest file `src/assets/js/scripts.js`.

For importing use `import` statement. For example:

```js
import 'bootstrap/js/dist/dropdown.js';
import "./blocks/block-name.js";
```

`node_modules` path is included for importing vendor files.

### SVG sprites

We use 2 types of svg sprites:
- [SVG Symbols](https://allusis.net/blog/2018/svg-sprites-for-icon-systems)
- [SVG Fragments](https://css-tricks.com/svg-fragment-identifiers-work/)

#### Symbols

1. For symbols sprites put your files in the `src/assets/img/sprites/svg-symbols/` directory.
2. In your pug file use mixin for sprite `+icon('icon-name', 'class-name')`.

#### Fragments

1. For fragments sprites put your files in the `src/assets/img/sprites/svg-fragments/` directory.
2. Use your sprite in the css `background-image: url('../img/svg-fragments.svg#icon-name')`.


### Sourcemaps

We use sourcemaps for Javascript and Sass files. It will be automaticly added to compiled js and css files via `base64`.

If you need to remove sourcemaps for production build, just run `gulp --production`.

### Bootstrap

We use only the necessary components like: reboot, grid, utilities from the source files. For example:

```sass
@import bootstrap/scss/functions
@import bootstrap/scss/variables
@import bootstrap/scss/mixins
@import bootstrap/scss/reboot
@import bootstrap/scss/grid
@import bootstrap/scss/utilities/display
@import bootstrap/scss/utilities/flex
```
If you need some other components, just import them from the source files. [Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/#importing)

### Bourbon for SASS

[Bourbon](https://www.bourbon.io/) is included in the boilerplate. It's the first-class library of Sass Mixins. For example we use font-face mixin for custom fonts declaration:

```sass
+font-face("#{$general-font}", "../fonts/#{$general-font}", ("woff2", "woff", "ttf"))
  font-style: normal
  font-weight: 400
```

### Fonts conversion

For covertation fonts into the web formats put your `ttf` fonts in the `src/assets/fonts/` directory and then run `gulp convertFonts`. It will be converted into `woff2`, `woff` and `eot` formats in the same directory.

### PostCSS Plugins

Some included plugins:

- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- [postcss-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-svg/v/1.0.6)
- [postcss-assets](https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets)
